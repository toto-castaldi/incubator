H.264
=====

H.264 or MPEG-4 Part 10, Advanced Video Coding (MPEG-4 AVC) is a block-oriented motion-compensation-based (an algorithmic technique used to predict a frame in a video, given the previous and/or future frames) video compression standard. As of 2014 it is one of the most commonly used formats for the recording, compression, and distribution of video content.[1] It supports resolutions up to 4096Ã—2304, including 4K UHD (Ultra High Definition).

The H.264 standard can be viewed as a "family of standards" composed of a number of different profiles. A specific decoder decodes at least one, but not necessarily all profiles. The decoder specification describes which profiles can be decoded. H.264 is typically used for lossy compression, although it is also possible to create truly lossless-coded regions within lossy-coded pictures or to support rare use cases for which the entire encoding is lossless.
