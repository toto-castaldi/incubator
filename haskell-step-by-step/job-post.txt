- care about doing things the right way
- we sell support and maintenance so quality really matters
- like communicating about what we do: blog posts, conferences (both internals and externals), etc

Our technical stack (this is what we have now, this is not we the required skills list neither the skills we will have tomorrow):

- Java/J2EE
- JavaScript/HTML5 for the client side: ES6, AngularJS, React.js, Polymer, Meteor.js, Node.js, etc
